#1. Node Port:
This is the simplest service exposure method, where a fixed port is opened on each node and mapped to the service's port.
Clients can access the service by using the node's IP address and node port.
The downside is that the same port needs to be opened on each node, limiting the reusability of the nodes.

#2. Load Balancer:
This method creates a load balancer outside the cluster, which distributes traffic to the corresponding Service.
The load balancer will have a public IP address, which clients can use to access the service.
This method can automatically configure load balancing and provides features like health checks and auto-scaling.
The downside is that it requires additional cloud service provider support, which can be more costly.

#3. Cluster Port:
This method uses Kubernetes' internal DNS to access the service, without exposing the service to the external network.
Other Pods within the cluster can access the service by using the service name.
This method is suitable for inter-service communication within the cluster, but not for exposing the service to the external network.
